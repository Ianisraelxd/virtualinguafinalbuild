        <span>Haploteuthis ferox</span> - Haploteuthis ferox is a peculiar
        species of deep-sea cephalopod. It gained scientific attention through a
        half-digested tentacle found near the Azores and a decaying body
        discovered by Mr. Jennings near Landâ€™s End in 1896. The species was not
        well understood, and the story suggests that the study of deep-sea
        cephalopods was largely in the dark at that time. The Prince of Monaco's
        1895 expedition, triggered by a cachalot incident, led to the discovery
        of several new forms of cephalopods, including Haploteuthis ferox.

        Cephalopods - refer to a class of marine animals characterized by a
        prominent head, large eyes, and tentacles. This group includes various
        species such as squids, octopuses, cuttlefish, and nautiluses.
        Cephalopods are known for their complex behaviors, intelligence, and
        well-developed nervous systems. They are mollusks, belonging to the
        Phylum Mollusca, and are distinguished by their unique adaptations for a
        marine lifestyle.

        Uncertainties - refer to situations or aspects characterized by a lack
        of predictability, assurance, or clarity. In the context of the story
        about Haploteuthis ferox, uncertainties may include challenges or gaps
        in understanding deep-sea cephalopods, such as incomplete knowledge
        about their behaviors, habitats, or life cycles. It implies a state of
        not having full confidence or precision in the information available.
