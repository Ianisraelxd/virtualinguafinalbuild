              I move through the forest, gliding through the trees and shrubs
              like a ghost. It is effortless to move this way, but it hasn’t
              always been. In a ravine ahead I see bushes weighed down with
              gooseberries. I spend a few minutes picking each bush clean and
              place the berries in a small leather bag. The shadows are growing
              longer. It’s time to go back.
              <br />
              <br />
              The barely noticeable deer trail will lead back to the camp. I
              begin to glide again, moving quickly but making no sound. The sun
              peeks through the foliage, disappearing and reappearing as I weave
              through the trees. The stillness of the forest is broken. A
              metallic clang on the path ahead echoes through the woods like a
              gunshot. Creaking and groaning noises fill the forest as bushes
              snap and small trees fall. The noise grows louder. I haven’t made
              a sound. How could it have found me? I scamper to the right side
              of the small path and find a huge stone lying there. I duck behind
              it and peer out of a small crack in the rock.
              <br />
              <br />
              The creaking and groaning grows louder still. I can see it now. I
              have seen it a few times before. It is jet black, about the size
              of a small bus. It moves along the deer trail in the same
              direction I had originally come. Its long legs snap through small
              trees and undergrowth as easily as if they were toothpicks. The
              metallic frame is mostly closed in, but on the sides there are two
              openings which are covered in a metal screen. These “ears” of the
              machine are known to be a marvel of technology, even in this world
              where technology rules all. It has been said that the ears can
              hear a whisper 20 miles away. While some still scoff at this idea,
              I don’t doubt it. At my last camp there were some who were
              careless. Because of them we were discovered. Everyone was sent
              fleeing in every direction like insects when a rock gets turned
              over. I haven’t seen anyone from my old camp since that day.
              <br />
              <br />
              On the day my old camp was destroyed, I followed the stream into
              the canyon walls until stumbling upon the small settlement where I
              now live. Eric greeted me soundlessly. We spoke that night,
              whispering as the wind rustled in the treetops. He told me that we
              may be the last group of natural humans on planet earth. Outside
              the camp, the few remaining in our species have their hardware
              implanted and activated. They move as one with the machines,
              thinking as they do. Their wills are intertwined with circuits and
              wires. I feel the scar on the back of my skull sometimes, an ugly
              reminder that I wasn’t always on the run fleeing to the remote
              areas of what used to be known as the western United States. The
              hardware was implanted when I was a child, but I don’t remember it
              being put in. In those early days I do remember hearing a child
              screaming in the night, my parent’s faces covered with worry and
              fear. A baby born in this time of war between man and machine. He
              also had a scar on the back of his skull. I was no longer only a
              child, I was also a sister.
              <br />
              <br />
              The terrible night came soon after that. We woke up to explosions
              rocking our apartment. Glass was shattering, distant screams and
              sirens could be heard in the streets down below. My parents
              gathered us up and brought us out of the building just before it
              collapsed. We ran along the street with hordes of screaming
              people. My mother had a tight grip on my hand, but then she was
              ripped away from me. I was lost in the swirling crowd. I have been
              on my own as I have grown older, traveling from camp to camp and
              moving further into the wilderness and away from the terrors of
              the city. My name is Miriam. I am a vagrant with no home, no
              family. A part of a remnant of humanity which is free to use their
              own minds, hardware intact but not yet activated.
              <br />
              <br />
              – The gleaner is gone now. I haven’t heard the tell-tale snapping
              and cracking for several minutes. My noiseless glide through the
              forest begins again. I don’t go straight back to the camp, but
              instead take a winding route, crossing over the stream several
              times. Descending from rock to rock on the steep, narrow path on
              the canyon wall, I can see the top of the cottonwood tree which is
              at the center of the small settlement. It stands alone in the
              clearing, surrounded by a grassy expanse which leads to the stream
              which cuts through the canyon on the other side. Though it is
              growing dark I can also see the cabins that are positioned around
              the tree. The walls are made of pine logs, covered at the top with
              a tangled mess of dead juniper branches. The cabins must not look
              unnatural to the eyes overhead.
              <br />
              <br />
              Eva greets me at the entrance to our little village, her gray hair
              rustles in the breeze as she signs her thanks for the provisions
              in my little bag. She is the oldest in the camp, but she is also
              the strongest in her own way, unyielding to the changing times
              around her. Eric stands beside her, I can tell that he is worried
              that I was out so late. Eric has always been like a father to me.
              Ever since the day that I first found my way into the canyon he
              has been willing to accept me and to teach me about how to
              survive. I was only a scared little girl then, but now as I have
              become older I have grown in my confidence. Of course, I’m
              careful. But not afraid, at least, not most of the time. As I have
              grown older Eric often asks for my opinion when he makes decisions
              for the good of the camp, but he does not always take me into his
              confidence. About a week ago he left the camp for three entire
              days. Where did he go? Where did he sleep? I could see these
              questions written on the faces of everyone. But we did not speak
              of it. Not even in a whisper.
              <br />
              <br />
              Eric has been a good leader. I go to my little cabin and I lie
              down on a mat as the canyon darkens. The evening meal is brought
              to me in a small wooden dish. It contains berries, nuts, roots and
              a small portion of dried meat. It is enough. In the night I hear
              the wind rustling in the leaves of the cottonwood tree. I find
              Eric sitting alone by the stream. I sit beside him and wait. As
              the wind picks up I begin to whisper. “I saw a gleaner today. It
              must have been following me while I gathered in the forest. Eric,
              it was almost inside the walls of the canyon. I’ve never seen one
              this close to camp before.” Eric listens as he looks out at the
              stream. When the wind begins again he leans toward me and whispers
              his response. “I’ve been traveling for miles, searching for a
              place to relocate. Strongholds are all around us. We are probably
              in the last place that is undetectable, and it will soon be
              discovered by them.”
              <br />
              <br />
              “So what do we do?” I ask. I don’t like his tone. It seems
              resigned. He is our leader. If he doesn’t have a plan we have no
              hope. He sighs. “It’s time that we consider speaking with them. We
              can’t live like this forever. “ “Giving ourselves up? Are you
              crazy?” My voice is now slightly more than a whisper. “What
              happened to surviving? You said we could make a stand if we wait
              longer.” Eric says nothing in response, he stares out at the
              water. I go on. “We need to have a meeting. Everyone needs to know
              what we are up against. We need to decide what we will do.
              Together.” The wind has died down again. We sit in silence for a
              few minutes. I can’t believe I am speaking to him like this, but
              what is he thinking? We are quite possibly the last unactivated
              humans on the planet. We must survive. We must resist at all
              costs. Eric finally looks at me. “You’re right. We will have a
              meeting tomorrow night if the conditions are good.”
              <br />
              <br />
              The hours creep by in the quiet stillness of the night. I think
              about waking Eva. Maybe she could speak with Eric. In the morning
              the camp is already bustling. Some have already left to hunt while
              others are washing clothes in the stream. Eva is working in the
              storehouse, preparing food for the day ahead. Where is Eric? I
              check his cabin and find that the door is open. Maybe he left
              earlier to hunt. I join Eva in the storehouse to help her with her
              work. She pauses as I enter the doorway but then continues, laying
              out small strips of meat on a screen as she cuts them. Her
              wrinkled face is furrowed as she concentrates. My hands become
              slimy and red, covered with blood. We place the frames in a sunny
              spot at the edge of the camp, propping them up on rocks.
              <br />
              <br />
              She gestures for me to follow her as we walk along the edge of the
              stream, farther away from the camp. We cross the stream on a
              fallen log and she leads me to a place where the water runs
              straight toward the canyon wall leaving a small peninsula. A bush
              is at the furthest point of this area and its branches hover above
              the water. Behind the bush there is a huge crack in the canyon
              wall a little less than two feet wide. Water runs out of the
              bottom of the crack over the roots of the bush and into the
              stream, making a trickling sound as it drips over the edge. Eva
              crouches down beside the stream in a place where we are out of
              view of the camp. She leans towards me and whispers. “Eric has
              been acting strange lately. I’m worried that he –” Her voice
              trails off as the trickling waterfall covers it. “We may need to
              make other plans.”
              <br />
              <br />
              “I spoke with Eric last night. He wants to hold a meeting after
              the evening meal. We could wait until after then.” Eva replies,
              “Yes, we will give him a chance to speak for himself. But if he
              doesn’t answer well then we need to come up with a solution on our
              own.” She turns and looks at me with an intense gaze. “ You need
              to be brave, Miriam. It will be hard to confront him.” She doesn’t
              know that I have already confronted him. His answer to me last
              night definitely wasn’t what she would want to hear. But if I
              reveal this it may tear the camp apart. We would lose the trust
              that we have worked so hard to build in the last several years. No
              one is willing to give themselves up willingly. Stubbornness and
              rebellion course through our veins. It unites us and links us
              together.
              <br />
              <br />
              Eric will have to answer tonight, but I will not speak for him. If
              he had turned me away on that day that I came wandering into camp
              I would surely be caught by now. I would be activated. The day
              creeps by slower than the night. It is evening now. Most have
              returned from hunting and foraging, Eva receives their findings
              with enthusiasm no matter how meager they are. But where is Eric?
              I bring the knives from the storehouse to the stream and kneel
              down to wash them. I hear a sharp crack at the edge of the forest.
              I stand, straining my eyes to see into the shadows of the trees.
              <br />
              <br />
              Then I see them. Three, maybe four gleaners are crawling at the
              edge of the forest, heading towards me, toward the camp. I quickly
              turn back to the camp and something immediately catches my eye
              beyond it on the other side of the clearing. A large tree is
              falling. In the distance I can see more shadows emerging from the
              forest on the other side of the clearing. We are surrounded. The
              only way out is the path up the rock wall, but surely we cannot
              all make it up in time. I begin to run back toward the camp. I
              haven’t spoken one word above a whisper in years. Now that it is
              time to warn the others my throat feels dry and constricted. My
              feet begin to move faster, pounding the sandy soil beneath me. I
              see the gleaners beyond continue their movement out of the forest,
              they are almost in the clearing now.
              <br />
              <br />
              A strength fills me as I continue to gain speed. “RUN!” My voice
              is unrecognizable to me as it pours out of my mouth and seems to
              shake the camp with its power. Eva comes out of the storehouse and
              begins running towards me. Some of the others come rushing out of
              their cabins and I see their eyes grow wide as the gleaners move
              in on both sides. They have emerged fully from the woods beyond.
              There are eight in total, their jet black frames moving at a
              steady pace, each with one red eye focused toward us as they close
              the gap in the clearing. Everyone is frozen for a moment. Some
              remember the little path up the canyon wall and begin to run
              toward it. Over the top of the canyon I see something flying low
              with lights shining underneath. It moves with great speed as it
              lowers itself into the walls. There is a streak of light and a
              deafening roar makes us all fall to the ground.
              <br />
              <br />
              The cottonwood tree explodes. Several of the cabins instantly
              catch fire with flames licking up the sides. The helicopter hovers
              over us as we scatter. Those that were headed toward the path on
              the canyon wall are cut off by a gleaner. Eva and I are running
              toward the little peninsula where we spoke yesterday. We scramble
              over the fallen log and Eva points to the crack in the canyon
              wall. “GO!” she shrieks. I make a quick glance around us. A
              gleaner moves toward our location, its red eye pointing at us. A
              light from the helicopter shines down, spotlighting our location
              as if we are on stage. I squeeze myself into the crack in the
              canyon wall, straining as I move forward. The walls press against
              me so tightly that I cannot take a full breath. I can hear Eva
              scrambling in behind me. A blinding red light beams into the
              crevice, illuminating our bodies as we push further into the space
              ahead. Eva screams. I look back and see her convulsing figure, her
              eyes looking at me in desperation.
              <br />
              <br />
              Then she stops struggling. A white light shines from behind her
              eyes as she looks toward me with a blank expression. She begins to
              move out in the same direction we came. I grab her arm but she
              pushes me away with seemingly supernatural strength. I try again
              to pull her deeper into the cavern but this time her hand reaches
              for my throat. She tightens her grip as I try to peel her fingers
              off of my neck. She pulls me closer to her, closer to the opening.
              The blank expression still covers her face. The white light from
              behind her eyes illuminates the walls. “Eva!” I croak. “Don’t do
              this!” The light shining from behind her eyes seems to flicker. A
              hint of recognition washes over her face. Her grip loosens just
              enough for me to pull her hand away. I begin to push my way
              deeper, still looking back. The light behind her eyes intensifies
              and she screams again.
              <br />
              <br />
              I keep straining, pushing my way deeper into the crevice. The
              floor begins to rise higher. Sharp rocks cut into my legs. I feel
              warm blood running down to my feet which slip on the wet, cutting
              edges of the uneven surface below. Every once in a while I smell
              smoke from the burning camp which wafts its way into the walls.
              After almost an hour of struggling forward, the crevice opens up a
              bit. Cold water continually runs over my feet as I move up a
              small, trickling stream toward its source. I see a faint
              illumination of the darkening sky above as I make my way further
              upwards, moving from rock to rock in the blackness below. I can
              see the sky not only above me, but also ahead. Soon I am in the
              open air, lying face down on the ground panting for breath.
              <br />
              <br />
              The helicopter is still hovering in the distance. Tears stream
              down my face as I breathe with sharp, uneven breaths, my body
              shaking from shock and exhaustion. After a few minutes I struggle
              to my feet. Pain shoots through my legs as I put weight through
              them, moving toward a stretch of forest ahead of me. I begin to
              walk, limping at first but then gaining speed. The branches of the
              trees hang over me like a thick blanket. The night breeze pushes
              me onwards as I begin to glide through the forest, making my way
              over logs and through bushes. Confidence begins to flow through me
              as my legs grow stronger with each quiet stride. There must be
              others out in this wilderness. There must be more who will stand
              up to the machines instead of cowering and betraying as Eric did.
              I am a survivor. My hardware is intact but I am not yet activated.
              I will resist. I won’t give in without a fight.
