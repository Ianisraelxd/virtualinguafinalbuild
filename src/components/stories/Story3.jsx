              The crisp autumn breeze caressed her cheeks. The hair that had
              fallen over her eyes swept back, along with the loose leaves of
              the tree in which she was residing. The lit torches on the stone
              wall flickered at the sudden gust. She felt her heart stop, her
              stomach drop to her aching feet.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              “No,” she whispered, horror crashing through her.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              The wind gusted again, harder, the scant clouds above beginning to
              move faster across the night sky. Panic crashing into her, she
              watched the guards on the wall. They did not seem to notice the
              shift in the wind. Did not seem to realize how it changed their
              fates.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              She clambered down the tree, skin scratching against the tough
              bark. Her bare feet hit the grass seconds later. In the next
              moment, she was sprinting through the forest, flying silently
              through the trees as she retraced the path she had traveled
              earlier in the evening.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              The camp came into view thanks to the ample starlight—there were
              no torches lit, despite the commotion that reached her ears.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              Fire would give away their position, a position they had worked
              for years to secure. She pushed her way through the first ring of
              tents, some alarmed comrades starting at her sudden appearance,
              and ran straight to the center of their base.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              “Commander!” she gasped, skidding to a halt beside him. He turned
              from the comrades before him, face stern, no emotions playing in
              the dark irises. “Why have you abandoned your post?” he hissed.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              “The wind,” she explained through her gasps. “The wind shifted,
              Commander. It is against us now. We must call off the attack.” The
              camp around them grew quiet at her words.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              “We cannot call off the attack,” the Commander said slowly, hand
              drifting to the hilt of the sword on his hip. “We have worked too
              long to get to this point.”
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              “We are already at a disadvantage, being downhill of the wall,”
              she snapped back, anger replacing the panic. “With the wind
              against us now, we will not be able to breach it.”
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              “The guard is reduced tonight, and reinforcements will return
              tomorrow. Our window will close then. It must be tonight.” He
              turned away from her. A dismissal.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              “Commander!” she yelled, grabbing his armored shoulder. The crowd
              around her murmured at the bold move. “We may still have a chance
              tomorrow. But if we attack with the wind against us, many will
              die. We will not be successful!”
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              “You have forgotten your place!” he yelled, swiveling back to face
              her. “Return to your post. Wait for our signal. If you abandon it
              again, you abandon your right to live.”
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              He stormed off, into the largest tent of the camp. Her comrades
              dissipated, not one of them daring to approach her. She stood,
              trembling slightly, as they all resumed their duties. The wind
              pulled at her hair again. She did not bother hurrying as she made
              her way back to her post. The rough bark did not bother her as
              much as she pulled herself up each branch, body as numb as her
              mind. She silently rested on the thin branch, tree swaying in the
              wind, and stared unseeingly at the fort before her. Rebelling
              against tyranny had seemed noble. Four years ago, the decision had
              been easy for her. The Commander and his party had arrived too
              late, the town already reduced to cinders, but they had waded
              through every corpse until they found her. Barely breathing, they
              had carried her to safety, while the wind had carried the ashes of
              her family in the opposite direction. Now, things were not so
              black and white.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              After years, with only small victories fueling them forward, she
              realized there would be no vengeance for her fallen family. There
              would be no dismantling the rulers that stole without reason, that
              killed without hesitation. If they found her alive after this
              failed siege...her fate would be worse than death. The sound of a
              bird call echoed from below. Her body went ridged at the signal,
              heart racing ahead. The soft sound of leaves crunching alerted her
              to the presence of the Commander and his company. Below her,
              shadows moved through the trees, weapons drawn. All that was left
              of their host stood below her. They stopped their forward motion,
              waiting for her. She reached for the bow strapped to her back. The
              weapon was a familiar weight in her hand. The quiver at her hip
              was full of arrows, but one was longer than the others. Heavier.
              She reached for that one. She only had one shot.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              One chance to make this count. The fort before them was still
              unaware of their presence in the trees. The late hour of the night
              had the small array of guards gazing at the stars above their
              heads, rather than the forest at the bottom of the hill. She
              didn’t blame them. No one in their right mind would dare dream of
              sacking this fort, not when its rulers had held it for a thousand
              years. But no one in this company was in their right mind.
              Misfits, held together underneath a banner of grief. A party that
              knew loss enough to not fear death. Free people with nothing left
              to lose.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              She took a deep, steadying breath. Her feet scrapped on the bark
              as she slid herself into a more balanced position. The arrow she
              nocked into place was one of a kind, specially crafted by her over
              the last week. The smell of gasoline made her nauseous. The
              Commander had given her reign over their scant supplies in order
              to do so. The last of their supplies. The last of their hope. She
              pulled back the nocked arrow, bringing it to her shoulder. Another
              steadying breath, and she leaned back, tilting the arrow towards
              the sky. The fort was uphill, upwind. The shot was impossible. She
              kept her eyes on the mounted torch.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              Her arrow would have to pass through the flame, would have to
              light, before it sailed into the interior and lit the arsenal of
              ammo that waited within the stone walls. Light guards, a heavy
              amount of explosive material horded within...the Commander had
              waited years for this opportunity. She would try for him. She
              would most likely die for him. Just then, the wind shifted.
