              “Sir, I am a murderer.” She was trembling while saying this. She
              was sitting in our police station, opposite to my table. She was
              there to surrender herself. I was in charge of the police station.
              She was a beautiful lady of about 22 or 23 years, had long hair
              which was maintained really nicely, wearing a pink shirt and dark
              blue jeans, and had sunglasses on her eyes. She was from a nice
              and rich family.
              <br />
              <br />
              “Who did you kill?” Well I asked her after taking a long pause
              because her first sentence was not really expected or if I talk
              frankly, I was lost in her beauty.
              <br />
              <br />
              “I have killed 3 people.” I was really surprised to hear that. A
              girl, so pretty, can kill 3 people and also commit it in front of
              police. The whole thing was a bit unusual for me.
              <br />
              <br />
              “I have killed my gardener, my driver and ……..” She paused a bit
              and started to sob. “And my mother.” She started crying hard. I
              gave her water and she started to take a sip from that glass. When
              she controlled her emotions, she continued to talk.
              <br />
              <br />
              “Please I beg of you, please arrest me otherwise I will kill
              someone else also.”
              <br />
              <br />
              “Why did you kill them and why will you kill others? Mam……….
              What’s your name?”
              <br />
              <br />
              “Shilpa.” She was still sobbing.
              <br />
              <br />
              “Shilpa, why did you kill them?”
              <br />
              <br />
              “I don’t know. It just happened automatically.”
              <br />
              <br />
              “Shilpa, I am not getting it. And I cannot arrest you without any
              complaint and without seeing the body of the dead people you are
              talking about.” She was looking very tense to me. So I continued,
              “Shilpa, where are the bodies?”
              <br />
              <br />
              “I dug them in my garden.” She was not looking fake but what she
              was saying did not even look to be believed. I decided to go to
              her house. I took two constables also with me. When we reached her
              house she took us to her garden and told us the places where the
              bodies of the gardener and driver were dug. I commanded the
              constables to take the bodies out.
              <br />
              <br />
              “Where’s the body of your mother?” I asked Shilpa.
              <br />
              <br />
              “Inside the home.” I started to follow Shilpa. She took me inside
              the house and then stopped in front of a dark room. “Inside. My
              mother is lying inside.” She started to cry again. I slowly
              started to move inside the room. The room was so dark that it was
              difficult to see anything. I had one torch with me so I decided to
              turn that on. I searched the whole room but the room was empty.
              Then I saw one room which was closed. I opened that room. And got
              shocked to see that there were three bodies lying inside the room.
              Two men may be Shilpa’s gardener and driver and one old lady may
              be her mother. I was wondering why Shilpa told me that bodies are
              out there in the garden.
              <br />
              <br />
              “Ahhhhhh………” Someone stabbed me from behind. I turned around. I
              was shocked to see Shilpa standing with a knife in her right hand
              covered with blood of mine. “Why?” I asked her in a trembling
              voice. She came closer to me and stabbed me in my stomach and
              said, “Because, it’s fun.” I fell to the ground and she took my
              gun and rushed outside. I heard two fires. She killed my
              constables. I saw her last image standing in front of the mirror,
              combing her hair and singing songs………….
